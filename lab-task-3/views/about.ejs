        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
          We bring together esports-inspired artwork and strategic gameplay to create collectible cards
          that feel great to own and fun to play. Every release is treated as a full “set” with its own lore,
          mechanics, and visual identity so your collection always tells a story.

        <h3>For Players & Collectors</h3>
        <p>
          Whether you are grinding ranked ladders or just love collecting rare foils, our catalog is
          designed with you in mind. We focus on balanced stats for competitive play while still offering
          ultra-rare variants, signed editions, and seasonal drops for collectors.

        <h3>Built With Express & EJS</h3>
        <p>
          This site demonstrates clean Express routes, EJS views, and partials for a modern e‑commerce
          layout using your existing HTML and CSS. It is structured similarly to production apps with routes,
          views, partials, and static assets organized for maintainability.

        <h3>Designed For Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond the visuals, this project is meant to help you practice routing, templating, and front‑end
          structure. You can easily plug in a real database or authentication system on top of this
          foundation as you progress.
